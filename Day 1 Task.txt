i). Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

                                                              HTTP - The Hypertext Transfer Protocol

                           HTTP/1.1                                                                                HTTP/2

       1.  It works on the textual format.                                                               1. It works on the binary protocol.

        2. There is head of line blocking that blocks all the                                 2. It allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is
        requests behind it until it doesnâ€™t get its all resources.                           required for multiple requests.
  
        3. It uses requests resource Inlining for use getting                               3. It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all
         multiple pages                                                                                             multiple pages

         4. It compresses data by itself.                                                                 4. It uses HPACK for data compression.

         5. html page & server responds to you as a resource                           5. The server sends all the other files like CSS & JS 
         sending the request and the response there is a                                    without the request of the client using the PUSH frame.
        TCP connection established between client & server. 
         
         6. Introduces a warning header field to carry additional                         6. Underlying semantics of HTTP such as headers, status 
        information about the status of a message. Can define                           codes remains the same.
       24 status codes, error reporting is quicker and more efficient.

        7. Expands on the caching support by using additional                           7. HTTP/2 does not change much in terms of caching. 
       headers like cache-control, conditional headers like                                  With the server push feature if the client finds the resources 
                                                                                                                                  are already present in the cache, it can cancel the pushed stream.
                                                                                                                                   If-Match and by using entity tags.
      
        8. Open the web developer tool on the web browser (like Firefox).          8. The server side we have major tech giants like Google, Facebook, 
                                                                                                                                    Nginx, etc




ii). Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript

        1. JavaScript, being a versatile programming language, offers a rich set of 
data structures, with objects being one of the most fundamental and powerful ones.

        2. JavaScript, objects are composite data types that allow you to store and 
organize data in key-value pairs.

        3. They can be created using the object literal notation or the object constructor 
function. 
Here's an example of an object representing a person:
                                      var person = {
                                              name: "iswariya",
                                              age: 23,
                                              session: "B52tamil"
                                       };

           4. Internally, objects in JavaScript are represented as unordered collections 
of properties. Each property consists of a key-value pair, where the key is a string 
and the value can be of any data type, including other objects. JavaScript engines 
use various techniques to optimize the storage and retrieval of properties within an object.

        5.  The keys are hashed to generate an index, which is used to efficiently 
store and retrieve the corresponding values. To access properties of an object, 
you can use dot notation or square bracket notation
          Example:
                                  console.log(person.name); 
                                       Output: "iswariya"
                                  console.log(person["age"]); 
                                      Output: 23

             6. Javascript arrays are special cases of objects.
                     typeof([ ]) == "object" 

           7. The syntax for adding a property to an object.
           Example:
                              var person = {
                                              name: "iswariya",
                                              age: 23,
                                              session: "B52tamil"
                               };
                               person.age = 24;
  
                             console.log(person.age); 
                                       Output: 24
          
             8. The syntax for deleting a property from an object.
              Example:
                              var person = {
                                              name: "iswariya",
                                              age: 23,
                                              session: "B52tamil"
                               };
                             delete person.session;
  
                             console.log(person); 
                                       Output:   { name: 'iswariya', age: 23 }
